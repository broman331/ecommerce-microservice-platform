# Serverless config for deploying Next.js using serverless-next.js component or similar
# For this "generic" example without specific provider credentials, we'll assume a standard AWS Lambda/S3 setup 
# or use a placeholder similar to backend services if we want to treat it as "just another service".
# However, Next.js usually requires specific handling (Amplify or dedicated component).
# Given the user just wants the "commands", we'll create a standard serverless.yml acting as if it's a simple dashboard or just artifact placeholder.

# In reality, for Next.js on Serverless, we'd use 'serverless-next.js' plugin or similar.
# For now, we will just put a placeholder build script or assume S3 sync.
